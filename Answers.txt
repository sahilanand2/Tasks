Task 2: Offline-First Strategy Considerations

1. Initial Steps to Transition to Offline-First Approach:
We'll start by understanding how data flows between our GraphQL backend and frontend. 
Then, we'll prioritize which parts of our app need to work offline and choose a storage method. 
Next, we'll set up a robust sync process between local storage and the main backend. Implementing smooth state management and improving error handling will ensure a seamless user experience.

2. Challenges Encountered with Offline Functionalities:
Challenges include maintaining consistency between local and server data, 
handling conflicts when multiple users edit offline, managing code complexity, and 
ensuring a smooth user experience despite connectivity issues.

3. Overcoming Challenges:
Solutions involve using optimistic UI updates for immediate user feedback, 
implementing conflict resolution strategies, utilizing background sync for seamless data updates, 
and maintaining clear documentation to manage complexity.

4. Helpful or Problematic Tools, Libraries, and Practices:
Tools like service workers for offline caching and Apollo Client for data management are beneficial. 
Custom offline solutions and browser compatibility issues can be challenging.

5. Emerging Technologies and Trends:
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates, and 
advancements in WebAssembly and edge computing are trends shaping improved offline experiences. 
These technologies aim to enhance performance and reliability in offline scenarios.
